###Rouglike Dungeon Crawler Game

Welcome to Rouglike Dungeon Crawler game. Part of Free Code Camp's Data Visualization certification. The game is built with ReactJS and Sass.

###The Goal

There are five dungeons in the game, each dungeon has five enemies. In the fifth dungeon, there is also a boss enemy. To win the game, the player needs to kill the boss.

###The maze

Each dungeon is a maze of randomly generated room and tunnels connecting them. In addition to the player and enemies, there are weapons, health items and stairs also placed randomly in the maze.

###How to find the boss

Each dungeon has stairs somewhere. The stairs move the player to next dungeon. Keeps taking stairs until fifth dungeon is reached. Find the boss and kill it... simple, right? No not really...

###How hard is it to kill the boss

The player has health, level, experience points (XP) and a weapon. Each enemy has a health and damage level.

As the player proresses through the dungeons, enemies become thougher and harder to kill, they also harm the player more and more. The boss is really tough and hard to beat... So how to kill it?

To kill the boss, the player needs to be as experienced and healthy as possible! experience is acheived by killing enemies, while health is maintained by collecting health items.

###XP and level

As the player kills enemies, experience points are earned. After the player earns a certain number of XP, the level increases. When the player level increases, health and weapon damage also get pumped up. So it's important that player tries to kill all enemies to acheive high power and damage to the enemy.

But attacking enemies will harm the player, and enemies get thougher when moving to a higher dungeon... what to do?

###Weapon and Health

In each dungeon there are health items that incrase the health level of the player. The increase in health increases with the dungeon number. So it is recommended to collect all health items to avoid death... Make sure that health do not go down to zero or you die :(

To inflect more damage on the enemy (and save on your health because attacks will be reduced), collect the weapon in each dungeon. An upgraded weapon can kill the enemy in less strikes which keeps the player healthy.

###Darkness mode

By default, the game is ran in darkness mode. Which means the dungeons and elements will be hidden except for a small rhombus surroinding the player. If you feel lost click on the "Toggle Lights" button to turn the lights on and see the whole maze. Click it again to go back to darkness mode.

ENJOY!
